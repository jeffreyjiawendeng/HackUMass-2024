            This program uses machine learning to capture and analyze facial expressions via your device’s front camera to identify emotions like happiness, sadness, and anger. By studying facial features in real-time, the system provides insights into human emotional states, exploring the boundaries of AI in emotion recognition.<br><br>

            User privacy is a top priority—no images are stored or shared. Data is discarded immediately after analysis, and users must give explicit consent before any image capture occurs.<br><br>
            
            This technology can enhance applications in areas such as customer service, mental health monitoring, and education, while ensuring ethical standards and respect for user privacy.<br>
